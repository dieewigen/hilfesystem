The Ewigen

The Ewigen Race is a humanoid nation whose origins are a secret. They say that this nation was already ancient while others where young.
They mastered multiple light velocity at an young age and thus they build colonies in many distant regions.
As a race of Explorer, deeply shaped by meditation, the Ewigen do not tend to inappropriate use of force. Hence their ships and planets are in comparison to other races well balanced regarding their attack and defensive power.

The Ishtar

The Ishtar are the most powerful and most respectable Merchants in the Universe. They have obtained most useful contacts through big expeditions everywhere in the outer space. On top of that, they are able to communicate without translator due to their telepathic skills.
It quickly turned out that the Ishtar were true masters in trading goods and other things. They maintain most Trade-Guilds and Trade-Outposts in the Universe.
In order to protect their Trade-Outposts, they have developed unbelievably powerful defensive fortifications so that no being with a sane mind would dare to attack them. Of course this could cause a trading boycott which wouldn't come in handy in a state of emergency.
