What does sDE, xDE and pDE stand for?

xDE is our mainserver (normal ticks: 15/60 min)
sDE is our speedserver (fast ticks: 3/12 min)
pDE were the private servers (they are currently not available)
ENSDE is our english server

Am I allowed to play on different servers at the same time?

Yes, you are. The servers run individually. You may not have more than one account on each server as this would be a violation of our terms of use.

Is the LAN-version of Die Ewigen downloadable somewhere or can I get it?

No, you cannot get it. The LAN-version is not disposable. You can only get the LAN-version for bigger LAN parties in connection with two DET members.

Is there a list available with old sDE and NDE winners?

Yes, there is. A toplist can be found at http://toplist.die-ewigen.com/. These statistics are not available for pDE.
