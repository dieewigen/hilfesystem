I did not receive my activation-email. What can I do?

In case that you did not receive your activation-email you should use the "Forgot password?" function. This function knows whether your Die Ewigen account was activated before or not. Non-activated accounts get an activation-email sent to their email address again.
If this method is not successful you should send an email to support@die-ewigen.com or contact a supporter directly. A list of supporters is available at our teampage.
When mailing us make sure to include the following information:
name of the server
name of your account or ingame nickname
Also make sure to send that email with the address you used for registration. DO NOT register a second account which would be a violation of our terms of use and would end up in a suspension of your account(s).

I misspelled my data while registering. How can I correct them?

For security reasons account data may only be changed by the DET (Die Ewigen Team) or supporters. Please contact them directly (e.g. via email). A list of supporters is available at our teampage.
Don't forget to add the corrected data to the email and make sure to send that email with the address you used for registration.

Can I use more than one account on one IP (e.g. for my brother, spouse)?

Yes, this is possible. They all may play Die Ewigen. We do never only look at the IP address used but at several factors. Nobody has to fear for their account only because there is more than one person playing on the same IP.
