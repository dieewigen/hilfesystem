The game

"Die Ewigen" is one of the first onlinegames, which was based on a tick-system. It has the cultic game Planetarion as exemplar. The game uses two different ticks. The first is the so-called economy tick, in which buildings are built and units and resources are delivered. The second tick is the war tick, in which the fleet flies and the battles take place.
Die Ewigen is a sector-based game which means that you play together with a few other players in a certain sector of the game. It is not possible to choose whether to play with certain other players or not. The sectors are randomly formed. Therefore, it is possible to form sector spanning alliances to play and fight together with your friends.
Our main server (xDE) uses 15 minutes as economy tick and 60 minutes as war tick. On the test server (sDE) and during battlerounds these times are reduced to 3 minutes (economy tick) and 12 minutes (war tick).

The gameuniverse

The main goal of the game is to gain power in the DE-universe. To achieve this goal you need to trade, get military power and be a good diplomat.
In general, the goal of each round is to reach the rank "Der Erhabene". "Der Erhabene" needs to hold a certain score (defined before a new round starts) for a certain timeframe. During this timeframe, it is, of course, also possible to overthrow the candidate for "Der Erhabene". In case that the candidate successfully completes this timeframe, he wins the game and the round is over. The ticks will freeze and no gaming actions can be run until a new round starts. For this reason you should recently check our infopages and our forums. There you can find the latest news.

The men of action

The conceptions to this game came by Issomad, Lysco und Grins. But there are more than these who took and take action in the development of the game. Everbody can make suggestions concerning the development of the game although there needs to be a certain use of new features. Many ideas could be added in this manner. Due to the work of nonpaid staffs the DET (Die Ewigen Team) always has a helping hand. At this point we want to thank everyone who offered his or her help. A staff overview (including the contact person) can be seen on the imprint-page.

Technical information

Die Ewigen currently operates 2 servers. One for the websites and one for the database. Of course we try to use the best hardware as possible but as Die Ewigen is exempt from charges we only have a small budget. We founded a development association to provide the possibility of voluntary contributions. Currently we have a broad-minded sponsor who provides us the servers for free.
The DET also thanks our sponsor on behalf of the users.
